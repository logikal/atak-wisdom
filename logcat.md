# Enabling logs
In ATAK, browse to Settings -> Support -> Logging Preferences -> Advanced Logging -> Enable Logcat File. This will create a log file in the ATAK directory on your device.

The log will be stored in a file named `logcat.txt`. A new file is created every time the app is started, so it might be named `logcat1.txt` or similar.

It's located at `Internal Storage/atak/support/logs/`
